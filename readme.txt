== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I use Taboola's Plugin? =
You must first contact us here at Taboola and we will get you started by setting up your account and providing you with your 'Publisher ID' and your 'Widgets ID'. After that all you need to do is download the plugin and get started.

= How quickly does it start working? =
Right away!

= To generate the highest revenue where should I place widgets on my site? =
Directly below articles is the best place to integrate our widget. Once the user has finished reading an article and is looking for something to do next our widget will recommend content that the user is most likely to click on.

= Will the widget slow down my site? =
No. The Taboola widget loads "asynchronously". This means your page will load independently of the widget script.

= How do I customize the UI of Taboola's widgets? =
After hundreds or A/B tests conducted we have reached a UI that outperforms anything else tested against it (on the same amount of real-estate). If you would like to change it please contact us here at Taboola http://taboola.com/contact
